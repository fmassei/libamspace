libamspace is a library with some useful space-related algorithms.

libamspace contains:
- ELP82
- VSOP87
- SGP (this comprehends SGP4, SDP4, SGP8, SDP8)
- some mathematical utilities (like Newton-Raphson method, Simpson Integration,
    Linear system solving by residue, Besselian interpolations, and much more)
- Mercator/UTM projections utilities
- Various handy stuff (algorithm on angles, rotations, ecliptic calculations,
    etc.)

The whole repository is "big" due to ELP82 and VSOP87 ephemerides, along with
a lot of test data. If you don't want (or already have) any of these just
download the "src" folder.
